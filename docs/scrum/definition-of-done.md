# Definition of Done

An Increment is "Done" when ALL criteria are met:

## Quality

- [ ] Implementation works as intended
- [ ] No known defects introduced
- [ ] Follows project conventions

## Testing

- [ ] Manual verification documented (test plan to be adapted once tech stack is decided)

## Transparency

- [ ] Changes are documented (what and why)
- [ ] Stakeholder can understand what was delivered

## Scrum

- [ ] Acceptance criteria from backlog item are met
- [ ] Increment is usable (not half-finished)
